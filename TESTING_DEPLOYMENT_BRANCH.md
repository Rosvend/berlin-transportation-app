# Testing the EC2 Deployment Branch

## âœ… Branch Created Successfully!

**Branch name:** `fix/ec2-deployment`  
**Commit:** `92785e1`  
**Status:** Pushed to GitHub âœ“

---

## ðŸ§ª Test Locally Before Deploying

### Quick Test (Recommended)
```bash
# Make sure you're on the deployment branch
git checkout fix/ec2-deployment

# Test with Docker Compose
docker-compose down
docker-compose up -d --build

# Wait a few seconds, then verify
docker-compose ps
# All containers should be "Up" and "healthy"

# Test in browser
open http://localhost:3000
# Should work exactly like before!
```

### If Everything Works:
```bash
# The deployment fixes work AND local dev still works âœ…
# You can safely deploy to EC2
```

### If Something Breaks:
```bash
# No problem! Switch back to main
git checkout main

# Local dev is untouched and still works âœ…
```

---

## ðŸš€ Deploy to EC2 (After Testing Locally)

### Option 1: Using the Fix Script (Easiest)
```bash
# SSH into EC2
ssh -i your-key.pem ubuntu@YOUR_EC2_IP

# Navigate to the app
cd ~/berlin-transportation-app

# Fetch the new branch
git fetch origin

# Switch to the deployment fix branch
git checkout fix/ec2-deployment

# Run the fix script
./fix-ec2.sh
```

### Option 2: Manual Deployment
```bash
# On EC2
cd ~/berlin-transportation-app
git fetch origin
git checkout fix/ec2-deployment
sudo docker-compose down
sudo docker-compose up -d --build
```

---

## ðŸ”„ Workflow Options

### Scenario A: Everything Works Perfect âœ¨
```bash
# Merge deployment branch into main
git checkout main
git merge fix/ec2-deployment
git push origin main

# Now main has the deployment fixes
```

### Scenario B: Keep Branches Separate ðŸ”€
```bash
# Keep main for local development
# Use fix/ec2-deployment for EC2 only

# On EC2, always use:
git checkout fix/ec2-deployment
```

### Scenario C: Something Broke ðŸ˜±
```bash
# Local machine - switch back
git checkout main

# EC2 - switch back to main
cd ~/berlin-transportation-app
git checkout main
sudo docker-compose up -d --build
```

## ðŸ“Š Changes in This Branch

All changes are deployment-focused and backward compatible:

| What Changed | Impact on Local Dev | Impact on EC2 |
|--------------|---------------------|---------------|
| `frontend/config.js` | âœ… Detects localhost | âœ… Detects EC2 IP |
| CORS settings | âœ… Still works | âœ… Now works |
| Docker health checks | âœ… Still works | âœ… Now works |
| nginx config | âœ… Still works | âœ… Better MIME types |

**Bottom line:** Local dev should work exactly the same! ðŸŽ¯

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps

1. **Test locally first:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d --build
   # Visit http://localhost:3000
   ```

2. **If all good, deploy to EC2:**
   ```bash
   # SSH to EC2 and run fix-ec2.sh
   ```

3. **Verify on EC2:**
   - All containers healthy
   - App accessible at `http://YOUR_EC2_IP:3000`

4. **Share with classmates:**
   - Give them the URL
   - Enjoy! ðŸŽ‰
